# blur

blur is a program made for easily and efficiently adding motion blur to videos through frame blending and interpolation.

Based on the work done on <https://github.com/f0e/blur> 

## Warning - Preproduction

This is still in the early stages of development so not much support can be provided and no guarentee on performance and bugs/issues that you may run into
if you do choose to use it and run into said issues then do create a issue here on github or send me(Anima) a dm on any social media

## Usage

Run the program

### Cli

blur can be run from the command line

e.g.

```powershell
./blur.exe -n demo.mp4
```

### Config

When first run it creates a config file in your home folder. `C:/users/user/blur-config.yml` for example which allows you to change the settings for the interpolation and enconding processes

again same thing applies and that being that not all the properties do anything or sometimes break the program.
